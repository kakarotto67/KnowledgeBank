#### Definition
- Requirements define the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software
- Stakeholders are
  - Customers
  - Users
  - Business Analytics, Developers, Testers, Project Managers, etc.
- Requirements Engineering covers
  - Requirements Development
    - Elicitation
    - Analysis
    - Specification
    - Validation
  - Requirements Management
- Levels of Requirements
  - Businesss Requirements
  - User Requirements
  - Functional Requirements
  - Non-functional Requirements
    - Usability
    - Security
    - Performance
    - Maintenability
    - Testability
    - Flexibility
    - Integrity
    - etc.
- Requirements specifications do not include design or implementation details
- Requirements risks
  - Low user involvement
  - Creeping user requirements
  - Not clear requirements
  - Gold plating
  - Minimal specification
  - Inaccurate planning
- Reguirement is excellent if it is
  - Complete
  - Correct
  - Feasible
  - Necessary
  - Prioritized
  - Unambiguous
  - Verifiable
- Benefits of excellent requirements
  - Low defects level
  - Less rework
  - Fewer unnecessary features
  - Faster development
  - Lower scope creep
- Costs of requirements errors on different project phases
  - Initial phase - 100 (enormous costs)
  - Final phase - 5-10 (minimal costs)
- Sources of requirements
  - Inverviews and discussions
  - Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents
  - Other documents
  - Problem reports
  - Surveys
  - Observing users at work
  - etc.

#### Techniques
- Brainstorming
  - Idea Generation, Idea Reduction, Idea Prioritization
- Interviews
  - Ask important stakeholders and note their answers
- Surveys
  - Run surveys with questions to collect some statistics
- Document Analysis
  - Analyze existing documents
- Focus Groups
  - Gather stakeholders >> Run brainstorming >> Produce report
- Interface Analysis
  - Define interfaces and solution components >> Describe how they interact
- Observation
  - Watch for a user and note its interaction with the system
- Requirements Workshops
  - Gather elaborative group for linking users with developers
- Prototyping
  - Prototype details of UI, create mockups, etc. Integrate the result with other requirements
