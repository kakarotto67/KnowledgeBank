#### SDLC Essentials
- Typical Stages
  - Requirements >> Design >> Implementation >> Verification >> Maintenance
- Spiral Methodology
  - Determine objectives >> Identify & resolve risks >> Development & testing >> Plan next iteration ...
- Iterative Methodology
  - Waterfal1 >> Waterfal2 >> ... >> WaterfalN
- Incremental/Agile Development
  - Kanban, Scrum, Dynamic System Development
- Prototyping (development approach)
  - Prototype1 >> Prototype2 >> ... >> PrototypeN
- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
  - Iterative methodology + Prototyping
  - Minimun meetings, maximum development, only important features are developed, documentation is important
- Lean Software Development (LSD)
  - Remove unnecessary stuff, learning is important, decide as late as possible, develir fast, responsible team
- Kanban (as type of LSD)
  - Start with existing process, board with queue of tasks, capacity of each team member

#### RUP and AUP
- Rational Unified Process (RUP) attributes:
  - Iterative development, requirements, components, modelling & visualization, testing & quality
- RUP Static structure:
  - Who? (Dev, QC, BA, etc.)
  - How? (Think >> Perform >> Review)
  - What? (Models, Sources, Documents, Executables, etc.)
  - When? (The plan)
- RUP Dynamic structure:
  - Sequential process (e.g., Waterfall)
  - Iterative lifecycle (Waterfall1 >> Waterfall2 >> ...)
  - Phases:
    1. Inception
    2. Elaboration
    3. Construction
    4. Transition
- Agile Unified Process (AUP) - derevied from RUP and describes different principles and rules of Agile methodology
  - The flow: Sprint Release 1 >> ... >> Sprint Release N >> Production Release 1 >> Sprint Release N+1 >> ...
- Use-Case-Driven Process
  - Attributes are the Actor and the Use Case

## SCRUM Process
#### Scrum Essentials
- Scrum in hierarchy of methodologies: Incremental Development -> Agile -> Scrum
- 3 main principles of Scrum:
  - Transparency
  - Inspection
  - Adaptation
- Typical Scrum meetings:
  - Daily meeting (Transparency)
  - Planning, Demo (Inspection)
  - Retrospective (Adaptation)
- Scrum flows/ceremonies:
  - Sprint Planning (grooming, pre-planning, planning, tasks breakdown)
  - Daily Scrum (daily meeting, stand-up)
  - Reporting (demo)
  - Sprint Review (retrospective)
- Scrum Rolew:
  - Product Owner (BA, customer, main stakeholder)
  - Scrum Master (responsible for Scrum rules and processes on the project)
  - Development Team (developers, testers, designers etc.)
- Scrum Artifacts:
  - Product Backlog
  - Sprint Backlog
  - Burndown Chart
- Scrum scaling - Scrum with multiple teams involved
