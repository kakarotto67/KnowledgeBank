#### Definition
- Requirements define the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software
- Stakeholders are
  - Customers
  - Users
  - Business Analytics, Developers, Testers, Project Managers, etc.
- Product Champion - main user in specific group. If users disagree - champion decides
- User Classes
  - Favored users
  - Disfavored users
  - Ignored users
  - Other users
- Assumptions and Constraints
  - Assumption - factors that are believed to be true, but have not been confirmed
  - Constraints - restrictions and limitations
    - Business constraints (time, resources, money)
    - Technical constraints (technical impact)
- Requirements Engineering covers
  - Requirements Development
    - Elicitation
    - Analysis
    - Specification
    - Validation
  - Requirements Management
- Requirements specifications do not include design or implementation details
- Requirements risks
  - Low user involvement
  - Creeping user requirements
  - Not clear requirements
  - Gold plating
  - Minimal specification
  - Inaccurate planning
- Reguirement is excellent if it is
  - Complete
  - Correct
  - Feasible
  - Necessary
  - Prioritized
  - Unambiguous
  - Verifiable
- Benefits of excellent requirements
  - Low defects level
  - Less rework
  - Fewer unnecessary features
  - Faster development
  - Lower scope creep
- Costs of requirements errors on different project phases
  - Initial phase - 100 (enormous costs)
  - Final phase - 5-10 (minimal costs)
- Sources of requirements
  - Inverviews and discussions
  - Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents
  - Other documents
  - Problem reports
  - Surveys
  - Observing users at work
  - etc.

#### Techniques
- Brainstorming
  - Idea Generation, Idea Reduction, Idea Prioritization
- Interviews
  - Ask important stakeholders and note their answers
- Surveys
  - Run surveys with questions to collect some statistics
- Document Analysis
  - Analyze existing documents
- Focus Groups
  - Gather stakeholders >> Run brainstorming >> Produce report
- Interface Analysis
  - Define interfaces and solution components >> Describe how they interact
- Observation
  - Watch for a user and note its interaction with the system
- Requirements Workshops
  - Gather elaborative group for linking users with developers
- Prototyping
  - Prototype details of UI, create mockups, etc. Integrate the result with other requirements

#### Modeling
- Use UML diagrams and SRS documents for requirements modeling
- Requirements modeling techniques
  - Pseudocode
  - UML diagrams
    - Use Case diagram
    - Activity diagram
    - Entity Relationships diagram
    - Data Flow diagram
    - Deployment diagram
    - Component diagram
    - Package diagram
    - Sequence diagram
  - Final state machines, Flowcharts, Decision tables and trees, etc.
- Entity Relationships Diagrams (ERD)
  - Entities (something important to the domain)
  - Attributes (name, value, description, etc.)
  - Relationships
  - Metadata
- Requirements artifacts
  - Product vision
  - Conflicting requirements
  - Scope documents
    - Business requirements
    - Vision of solution
    - Scope and limitations
    - Business context
  - SRS documents
    - Introduction
    - Overall description
    - System features
    - External interfaces requirements
    - Other non-functional requirements
    - Other requirements
    - A. Glossary
    - B. Models
    - C. Issues

#### Requirements Types
- Levels of Requirements
  - Business Requirements
  - User Requirements
  - Functional Requirements
    - Business Rules
    - Transactions
    - Administrative Functions
    - Authentication and Authorization
    - Audit, Certification, Reporting, etc.
  - Non-functional Requirements
    - Usability
    - Security
    - Performance
    - Maintenability
    - Testability
    - Flexibility
    - Integrity
    - Availability
    - Scalability
    - Extensibility
    - Interoperability
    - Data Integrity
    - Portability
    - Reliability
    - Modularity
- Software Quality Attributes (Non-functional requirements) importance
  - For Users
    - Availability, Efficiency, Flexibility, Integrity, Interoperability, Reliability, etc.
  - For Developers
    - Maintainability, Portability, Reusability, Scalability, Testability, etc.
