#### SDLC Essentials
- Typical Stages
  - Requirements >> Design >> Implementation >> Verification >> Maintenance
- Spiral Methodology
  - Determine objectives >> Identify & resolve risks >> Development & testing >> Plan next iteration ...
- Iterative Methodology
  - Waterfal1 >> Waterfal2 >> ... >> WaterfalN
- Incremental/Agile Development
  - Kanban, Scrum, Dynamic System Development
- Prototyping (development approach)
  - Prototype1 >> Prototype2 >> ... >> PrototypeN
- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
  - Iterative methodology + Prototyping
  - Minimun meetings, maximum development, only important features are developed, documentation is important
- Lean Software Development (LSD)
  - Remove unnecessary stuff, learning is important, decide as late as possible, develir fast, responsible team
- Kanban (as type of LSD)
  - Start with existing process, board with queue of tasks, capacity of each team member

## SCRUM Process
#### Essentials
- Scrum in hierarchy of methodologies: Incremental Development -> Agile -> Scrum
- 3 main principles of Scrum:
  - Transparency
  - Inspection
  - Adaptation
- Typical Scrum meetings:
  - Daily meeting (Transparency)
  - Planning, Demo (Inspection)
  - Retrospective (Adaptation)
- Scrum flows/ceremonies:
  - Sprint Planning (grooming, pre-planning, planning, tasks breakdown)
  - Daily Scrum (daily meeting, stand-up)
  - Reporting (demo)
  - Sprint Review (retrospective)
- Scrum Rolew:
  - Product Owner (BA, customer, main stakeholder)
  - Scrum Master (responsible for Scrum rules and processes on the project)
  - Development Team (developers, testers, designers etc.)
- Scrum Artifacts:
  - Product Backlog
  - Sprint Backlog
  - Burndown Chart
- Scrum scaling - Scrum with multiple teams involved
